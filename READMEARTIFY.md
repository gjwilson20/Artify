## ARTIFY

The Artify out of school club website is a landing page for parents looking for a fun out of school art club for their children aged 5 to 11. The club offers interesting activities for children to learn new art techniques from a young age and the chance to develop their creative skills.

Users of the site will be able to find all the information needed to know about the clubs on offer including meeting times, pricing a sign up form and the ability to contact the club with any further questions. The site is targeted towards parents of children who want to be creative in a more structured way.

## Features

Navigation - featured at the top of the page is the navigation bar which shows the club logo in the left corner which links to the top of the page.

The other navigation links are on the right: about us, sign up and contact which link to different sections of the same page.

The naviation is in a font that works with the logo font and is replaced with a bouncing pencil image that is clickable and hidden when on smaller device screens.

I ensured that there was an appropriate favicon created to match the brand colours and show in browser tabs.

## The about us section
![AboutUs](https://github.com/gjwilson20/Artify/assets/166746021/ca33d38c-7e59-4b90-a089-3c189b0f7d1a)

The section gives details about what the club offers their members and has an image of children promoting the club which was taken from Pexels.

The section clearly talks about some of the activities which would be on offer to pupils.

## Sign up form

The sign up form has details for parents about when clubs run and for which age groups and states the cost of the clubs. 

There is a table within the section showing the times and days clubs are run and for which age range.

There is a form on the section which allows parents to provide their child's name, the parents contact email and also a choice of check boxes to select which club they want to enrol their child on.

The section is coloured to allow parents to know they are on a different part of the site when on smaller devices.

- I tested the page works on different browsers including chrome and safari.
- I confirmed the project is responsive and looks good using devtools device toolbar.
- I confirmed that the navigation and other sections were all readable and easy to understand.
- I have confirmed that forms work and entries are required in the fields and that submit buttons work too.

## Bugs
when I deployed the project to GitHub Pages I discovered that there were a number of typing errors including / not needed and forms with no closing tags etc.  

I also found that some file names were not useable due to spaces left between words. These have been rectified.

## validator testing
- html - no errors were returned when passed through the official w3C validator.
- css - no errors were returned when passed through the official jigsaw validator.
- accessibility - I checked that colours and fonts chosen were easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse.

### content
the code to make the drop down toggle in the nav bar was taken from the love running project and from notes I had made along the way. 

When coding the site I used a range of websites to troubleshoot problems I came across and ended up typing code from places to see if it worked, I often had to amend this to make it fit my design and ensure it worked for my project. Sites i looked at included w3schools and Stackoverflow.
